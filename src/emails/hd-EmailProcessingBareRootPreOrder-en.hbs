            <p>Thank you for your order (order reference)</p>
            <p>Your order contains bare root plants which have been reserved. As soon as your plants are ready to be lifted, usually in November, we will despatch your whole order to you.</p>
            <p>Bare root plants are typically availble from November to April though our cold storage facility can extend this window a little later without having any negative effect on the quality of the plants. All the information regarding different root types and their availablility is available on our website. </p><br/><br/>
            <p/><b/>Ordered Turf or Trees?</b><br/> 
            If your order contains turf or trees as well as your bare root plants, the turf or trees <b/>will</b> be delivered seperately and you will be contacted to arrange a suitable date for delivery. </p><br/><br/>
            <p> <b/> Need Help Planting? </b><br/>Why not bookmark our Youtube channel for helpful videos on what you'll need and how to plant when your plants do arrive, including preparing the ground and using rootgrow.
